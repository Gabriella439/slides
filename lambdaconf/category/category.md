# Function composition

You can chain pure functions using Haskell's function composition operator:

```haskell
(f . g) x = f (g x)
```

```haskell
>>> (not . even . length) [1, 2, 3]
True
>>> not (even (length [1, 2, 3]))
True
```

You can also define an identity function that does nothing::

```haskell
id x = x
```

```haskell
>>> id 4
4
```

# Composition laws

Composition and identity obey the following properties:

```haskell
id . f = f                 -- Left identity

f . id = f                 -- Right identity

(f . g) . h = f . (g . h)  -- Associativity
```

... which are true for all possible values of `f`, `g`, and `h`

# Unix philosophy

Function composition pipelines greatly resemble Unix command line pipelines:

Compare this:

```haskell
not . even . length
```

... to this:

```bash
$ ls /tmp | grep foo | wc -l
```

* Function composition (i.e. `.`) resembles the Unix pipe (i.e. `|`)

* Functions (`not`/`length`/`even`) resemble Unix commands (`ls`/`grep`/`wc`)

* You create useful programs by decomposing them into simple programs

* Each simple program "does one thing and does it well"

* We compose simple functions into function pipelines

**Goal**: We want to extend composability to more complex software architectures

**Punch line:** Category theory is about composability

# Overview

* Composable values
* Practical example
* Composable types
* Conclusion

# `Monoid`

The simplest "composable" interface in Haskell is the `Monoid` typeclass:

```haskell
class Monoid m where
    mempty :: m

    mappend :: m -> m -> m

(<>) :: Monoid m => m -> m -> m
x <> y = mappend x y
```

All `Monoid` implementations must obey the following `Monoid` laws:

```haskell
mempty <> x = x                -- Left identity

x <> mempty = x                -- Right identity

(x <> y) <> z = x <> (y <> z)  -- Associativity
```

Look familiar?

```haskell
id . f = f                     -- Left identity

f . id = f                     -- Right identity

(f . g) . h = f . (g . h)      -- Associativity
```

# Example `Monoid` instance

```haskell
instance Monoid [a] where
    mempty = []

    mappend x y = x ++ y
```

Lists obey the `Monoid` laws:

```haskell
[] ++ x = x                    -- mempty <> x = x

x ++ [] = x                    -- x <> mempty = x

(x ++ y) ++ z = x ++ (y ++ z)  -- (x <> y) <> z = x <> (y <> z)
```

# Example usage

```haskell
>>> [7] ++ [11]
[7, 11]
>>> [7] <> [11]
[7, 11]
>>> mempty :: [Integer]
[]
>>> "ABC" <> "DEF"  -- type String = [Char]
"ABCDEF"
>>> ['A', 'B', 'C'] <> ['D', 'E', 'F']
"ABCDEF"
```

# Unit

```haskell
instance Monoid () where
    mempty = ()

    mappend () () = ()
```

```haskell
>>> () <> ()
()
>>> mempty :: ()
()
```

# Question for the audience

What is the point of providing `Monoid` instances for lists or `()`?

Why not use `(++)` instead of `(<>)` and use `[]` instead of `mempty`?

# `Monoid`-generic functions

We can write functions that are generic over the `Monoid` interface

```haskell
mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m
mconcat (x:xs) = mappend x (mconcat xs)
mconcat    []  = mempty
```

This `mconcat` function works for any type that implements `Monoid`

```haskell
>>> mconcat [[7, 11], [], [13]]
[7, 11, 13]
>>> mconcat [(), (), ()]
()
```

# `Monoid`-generic instances

We can also write `Monoid` instances generic over other `Monoid` instances

```haskell
instance (Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a, b) where
    mempty = (mempty, mempty)

    mappend (xL, yL) (xR, yR) = (mappend xL xR, mappend yL yR)
```

```haskell
>>> ([2], [3]) <> ([5], [7])
([2,5], [3,7])
>>> mempty :: ([Integer], [Integer])
([], [])
>>> mconcat [([], [2]), ([3, 5], [7]), ([], [11, 13])]
([3,5],[2,7,11,13])
```

# `Monoid`-generic proofs

We can even write proofs that are generic over the `Monoid` laws

```haskell
(xL, xR) <> mempty

-- x <> y = mappend x y
= mappend (xL, xR) mempty

-- mempty = (mempty, mempty)
= mappend (xL, xR) (mempty, mempty)

-- mappend (xL, yL) (xR, yR) = (mappend xL xR, mappend yL yR)
= (mappend xL mempty, mappend xR mempty)

-- mappend x mempty = x
= (xL, xR)
```

# Nesting `Monoid`s

The `Monoid` instance for 2-tuples works for any type `a` and `b`

... even if `a` and `b` are tuples!

That means that this type is a `Monoid`:

```haskell
(([Integer], [Integer]), [Integer])
```

* `[Integer]` is a `Monoid`
* ... and `(a, b)` is a `Monoid` if `a` and `b` are `Monoid`s ...
* ... therefore `([Integer], [Integer])` is a `Monoid`
* ... therefore `(([Integer], [Integer]), [Integer])` is a `Monoid`

We can nest tuples of lists indefinitely and they still form a `Monoid`:

```haskell
>>> ([1],([2],([3],([4],([5],()))))) <> ([6],([7],([8],([9],([10],())))))
([1,6],([2,7],([3,8],([4,9],([5,10],())))))
```

# `IO`

GHC 8 provides the following `Monoid` instance for `IO`:

```haskell
instance Monoid b => Monoid (IO b) where
    mempty = return mempty

    mappend ioA ioB = do
        a <- ioA
        b <- ioB
        return (mappend a b)
```

This means that these types are legal `Monoid`s:

```haskell
>>> getLine :: IO String
Hello<Enter>
"Hello"
>>> getLine <> getLine :: IO String
Hello<Enter>
, world!<Enter>
"Hello, world!"
```

```haskell
>>> print 1 :: IO ()
1
>>> print 1 <> print 2 :: IO ()
1
2
```

# Equational reasoning example

```haskell
getLine <> getLine

-- x <> y = mappend x y
= mappend getLine getLine

-- mappend ioA ioB = do a <- ioA; b <- ioB; return (mappend a b)
= do a <- getLine; b <- getLine; return (mappend a b)

-- mappend x y = x ++ y :: String
= do a <- getLine; b <- getLine; return (a ++ b)
```

```haskell
print 1 <> print 2

-- x <> y = mappend x y
= mappend (print 1) (print 2)

-- mappend ioA ioB = do a <- ioA; b <- ioB; return (mappend a b)
= do () <- print 1; () <- print 2; return (mappend () ())

-- mappend () () = ()
= do print 1; print 2; return ()
```

# Example

```haskell
import Data.Monoid

promptName :: IO (IO ())
promptName = do
    putStrLn "Enter your name:"
    name <- getLine
    return $ do
        putStrLn ("Your name is: " ++ name)

promptAge :: IO (IO ())
promptAge = do
    putStrLn "Enter your age:"
    age <- readLn
    return $ do
        putStrLn ("Your age is: " ++ show (age :: Integer))

main :: IO ()
main = do
    respond <- promptName <> promptAge
    respond
```

```
>>> main
Enter your name:
Gabriella Gonzalez
Enter your age:
31
Your name is: Gabriella Gonzalez
Your age is: 31
```

# Functions

Here's another `Monoid` instance:

```haskell
instance Monoid b => Monoid (a -> b) where
    mempty = \_ -> mempty

    mappend f g = \x -> mappend (f x) (g x)
```

```haskell
>>> putStrLn "Hi"
Hi
>>> (putStrLn <> putStrLn) "Hi"
Hi
Hi
```

# Chaining different monoids

The type of `putStrLn` implements `Monoid`:

```haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
```

... thanks to the following `Monoid` instances:

```haskell
instance Monoid ()
instance Monoid b => Monoid (IO b)
instance Monoid b => Monoid (a -> b)
```

```haskell
mappend putStrLn putStrLn

-- mappend f g = \x -> mappend (f x) (g x)
= \x -> mappend (putStrLn x) (putStrLn x)

-- mappend ioA ioB = do a <- ioA; b <- ioB; return (mappend a b)
= \x -> do () <- putStrLn x; () <- putStrLn x; return (mappend () ())

-- mappend () () = ()
= \x -> do putStrLn x; putStrLn x; return ()
```

# Questions?

# New `Monoid`: `Transaction`

Let's add a new `Monoid` to our toolbox:

```haskell
newtype Transaction a = Transaction { getTransaction :: STM a }

instance Monoid (Transaction a) where
    mempty = Transaction retry

    mappend (Transaction l) (Transaction r) = Transaction (l `orElse` r)
```

A `Transaction` can use `mempty` to block if they are not ready to complete

`mappend` takes the first transaction that does not block

# New `Monoid`: `Managed`

```haskell
-- | A managed resource
newtype Managed a = Managed { (>>-) :: forall r . (a -> IO r) -> IO r }

instance Monoid a => Monoid (Managed a) where ...
```

`mempty` acquires an empty resource

`mappend` acquires two resources and combines them

# Event streams are `Monoid`s

Let's layer `Managed` on top of `Transaction` to create a new `Monoid`:

# Questions?

* Composable values
* Practical example
* Composable types
* Conclusion

# Shared patterns

Let's revisit the `Monoid` instance for `IO`:

```haskell
instance Monoid b => Monoid (IO b) where
    mempty = return mempty

    mappend mA mB = do
        a <- mA
        b <- mB
        return (mappend a b)
```

Notice how there's nothing really `IO`-specific about this implementation

We only use `return` and `do`-notation, which work for any `Monad`

Therefore: we can write the exact same `Monoid` instance for any `Monad`

... and Haskell has lots of `Monad`s (in case you didn't notice)

# Functions

Our original `Monoid` instance for functions could have been written this way:

```haskell
instance Monoid b => Monoid (a -> b) where
    mempty = return mempty

    mappend mA mB = do
        a <- mA
        b <- mB
        return (mappend a b)
```

This works because `(a -> b)` is syntactic sugar for `(->) a b`

... and there is a `Monad` instance for `(->) a`:

```haskell
instance Monad ((->) a) where ...
```

# Pairs

Our original `Monoid` instance for pairs could have been written this way:

```haskell
instance (Monoid a, Monoid b) => Monoid (a, b) where
    mempty = return mempty

    mappend mA mB = do
        a <- mA
        b <- mB
        return (mappend a b)
```

This works because `(a, b)` is syntactic sugar for `(,) a b`

... and there is a `Monad` instance for `(,) a`:

```haskell
instance Monoid a => Monad ((,) a) where ...
```

# The pattern

In theory, we could write the following very general instance:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}

instance (Monad f, Monoid m) => Monoid (f m) where
    mempty = return mempty

    mappend mA mB = do
        a <- pA
        b <- pB
        return (mappend a b)
```

This instance always obeys the `Monoid` laws no matter what `m` and `b` are

In practice, we can't do this because we'd get overlapping instances 😕

# `Applicative`

In fact, we can generalize this to any type that implements `Applicative`:

```haskell
instance (Applicative f, Monoid m) => Monoid (f m) where
    mempty = pure mempty

    mappend = liftA2 mappend
```

Every `Applicative` implements `pure` and (indirectly) `liftA2`:

```haskell
pure :: Applicative f => a -> f a

liftA2 :: Applicative f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
```

```haskell
mempty  :: Monoid m => m

mappend :: Monoid m => m -> m -> m

pure mempty    :: (Monoid m, Applicative f) => f m

liftA2 mappend :: (Monoid m, Applicative f) => f m -> f m -> f m
```

# Chaining `Applicative`s

We can keep chaining `pure` and `liftA2`

```haskell
pure (pure (pure (... (pure mempty) ...)))
    :: ( Applicative f1
       , Applicative f2
       , Applicative f3
       , ...
       , Applicative fn
       , Monoid m
       )
    => f1 (f2 (f3 (... (fn m) ...)))

liftA2 (liftA2 (liftA2 ... (liftA2 mappend) ...))
    :: ( Applicative f1
       , Applicative f2
       , Applicative f3
       , ...
       , Applicative fn
       , Monoid m
       )
    => f1 (f2 (f3 (... (fn m) ...)))
    -> f1 (f2 (f3 (... (fn m) ...)))
    -> f1 (f2 (f3 (... (fn m) ...)))
```

# Example chained `Monoid` instance

```haskell
newtype Plugin = Plugin ([String], Config -> Managed (Transaction Event))

instance Monoid Plugin where
    mempty = Plugin (pure (pure (pure mempty)))

    mappend (Plugin x) (Plugin y) =
        Plugin (liftA2 (liftA2 (liftA2 mappend)) x y)
```

We don't need to prove the `Monoid` laws for `Plugin`

`Applicative` laws guarantee that this implementation is correct by construction

(Proof omitted)

# `Applicative` pipelines

A type like this:

```haskell
( Applicative f1
, Applicative f2
, Applicative f3
, ...
, Applicative fn
, Monoid m
) => f1 (f2 (f3 (... (fn m) ...)))
```

... is "an `Applicative` pipeline", analogous to a Unix pipeline:

* Each stage is an `Applicative` that "does one thing and does it well"
* We connect stages together with a "universal interface": `Monoid`
* The input to each stage is a `Monoid` and the output of each stage is a `Monoid`
* We can mix and match `Applicatives` just like we mix and match Unix commands

There's no limit to how complex of a pipeline we can build

# `Applicative` composition

We can define a type to "compose" `Applicative`s:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

import Control.Applicative

newtype (f `O` g) a = Compose { unCompose :: f (g a) } deriving (Functor)

instance (Applicative f, Applicative g) => Applicative (f `O` g) where
    pure x = Compose (pure (pure x))

    Compose l <*> Compose r = Compose (liftA2 (<*>) l r)

instance (Monoid a, Applicative f, Applicative g) => Monoid ((f `O` g) a) where
    mempty = pure mempty

    mappend = liftA2 mappend
```

# `Applicative` identity

We can also define an `Identity` of this type-level composition operator:

```
newtype Identity a = Identity { runIdentity :: a }

instance Applicative Identity where
    pure a = Identity a

    Identity f <*> Identity x = Identity (f x)

instance Monoid a => Monoid (Identity a) where
    mempty = pure mempty

    mappend = liftA2 mappend
```

# `Applicative` composition laws

We can even show that `Applicative` composition and identity obey these laws:

```haskell
Identity `O` f ≅ f                 -- Left identity

f `O` Identity ≅ f                 -- Right identity

(f `O` g) `O` h ≅ f `O` (g `O` h)  -- Associativity
```

Look familiar?

```haskell
id . f = f                         -- Left identity

f . id = f                         -- Right identity

(f . g) . h = f . (g . h)          -- Associativity
```

# Example `Applicative` composition

This means that we could also write `Plugin` as:

```haskell
type Plugin = ((,) [String] `O` (->) Config `O` Managed) (Transaction Event)
```

... and it's automatically a `Monoid`!

We are literally composing an `Applicative` pipeline

# Conclusion

We began from simple composable functions:

* Composition operator: `(.)`
* Identity: `id`
* Composable units: functions

... then generalized that to other composable values using `Monoid`s:

* Composition operator: `(<>)`
* Identity: `mempty`
* Composable units: `Monoid` values

... then generalized that further to composable types using `Applicative`s:

* Composition operator: `O`
* Identity: `Identity`
* Composable units: `Applicative` types

Abstractions from category theory (and abstract algebra) help decompose programs
into simple composable building blocks
