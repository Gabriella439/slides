This talk introduces the Dhall configuration language to functional programmers.

In this talk, I will cover:

* Using Dhall as an ordinary configuration file format
* Using Dhall as a programming language
* Dhall's tooling
* Dhall's language security guarantees

# What is Dhall?

Dhall is a [programmable configuration language](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/discussions/Programmable-configuration-files.html)
that you can think of as: **JSON + functions + types + imports**

Dhall originated as an academic exercise to settle the following question:

> Would people tolerate programmable configuration files if they were not
> Turing-complete?

The project then grew beyond my expectations, so I went with the flow and
learned a lot along the way.

# Dhall is like JSON

When I say Dhall is like JSON I mean that:

* Dhall can model scalars, records, and lists (and other things)
* You can marshal a Dhall configuration file directly into a program as data

Here is an example Dhall configuration file:

```haskell
{ home       = "/home/bill"
, privateKey = "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519"
, publicKey  = "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
}
```

… which corresponds to this JSON:

```bash
$ dhall-to-json --file ./config.dhall | tee ./config.json
```
```json
{
  "home":       "/home/bill",
  "privateKey": "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519",
  "publicKey":  "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
}
```

# JSON to Dhall

You can migrate an existing JSON file to Dhall.For example, this JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "discontinued": false,
    "description": "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked"
  },
  {
    "description": "Apple iPhone SE (64GB, Black)"
  }
]
```

… corresponds to this Dhall configuration:

```bash
$ json-to-dhall --file ./inventory.json
```
```haskell
[ { description = "Google Pixel XL 128GB Unlocked"
  , discontinued = Some False
  }
, { description = "Apple iPhone SE (64GB, Black)"
  , discontinued = None Bool
  }
]
```

# Dhall can also generate YAML

```haskell
[ { name = "John Doe"
  , age = 14
  }
, { name = "Mary Jane"
  , age = 13
  }
]
```

…  corresponds to this YAML:

```bash
$ dhall-to-yaml --file ./students.dhall 
```
```yaml
- age: 14
  name: John Doe
- age: 13
  name: Mary Jane
```

# YAML to Dhall

You can also convert YAML to Dhall.  For example, this YAML:

```yaml
docker:
    - image: ubuntu:14.04
    - image: mongo:2.6.8
      command: [mongod, --smallfiles]
    - image: postgres:9.4.1
```

… corresponds to this Dhall configuration:

```bash
$ yaml-to-dhall --file ./docker.yaml
```
```haskell
{ docker =
  [ { command = None (List Text)
    , image = "ubuntu:14.04"
    }
  , { command = Some [ "mongod", "--smallfiles" ]
    , image = "mongo:2.6.8"
    }
  , { command = None (List Text)
    , image = "postgres:9.4.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Real-world example - Dhall to YAML

Here is a more "real world" example of a Dhall configuration for Kubernetes:

```haskell
let kubernetes = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes/a4126b7f8f0c0935e4d86f0f596176c41efbe6fe/package.dhall sha256:ef3845f617b91eaea1b7abb5bd62aeebffd04bcc592d82b7bd6b39dda5e5d545

in  kubernetes.Deployment::{
    , metadata = kubernetes.ObjectMeta::{ name = Some "nginx" }
    , spec = Some kubernetes.DeploymentSpec::{
      , selector = kubernetes.LabelSelector::{
        , matchLabels = Some (toMap { name = "nginx" })
        }
      , template = kubernetes.PodTemplateSpec::{
        , metadata = kubernetes.ObjectMeta::{ name = Some "nginx" }
        , spec = Some kubernetes.PodSpec::{
          , containers =
            [ kubernetes.Container::{
              , name = "nginx"
              , image = Some "nginx:1.15.3"
              , ports = Some
                [ kubernetes.ContainerPort::{ containerPort = 80 } ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

# Real-world example - Dhall to YAML

… which corresponds to this YAML Kubernetes configuration:

```bash
$ dhall-to-yaml --file ./deployment.dhall
```
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: nginx:1.15.3
          name: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

# Real world example - YAML to Dhall

The reverse direction works, too, if we provide a bit more information:

```bash
$ yaml-to-dhall '(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes/a4126b7f8f0c0935e4d86f0f596176c41efbe6fe/types.dhall).Deployment' --file ./deployment.yaml \
  | dhall rewrite-with-schemas --schemas 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes/a4126b7f8f0c0935e4d86f0f596176c41efbe6fe/schemas.dhall'
```
```haskell
let schemas = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhall-lang/dhall-kubernetes/a4126b7f8f0c0935e4d86f0f596176c41efbe6fe/schemas.dhall

in  schemas.Deployment::{
    , metadata = schemas.ObjectMeta::{ name = Some "nginx" }
    , spec = Some schemas.DeploymentSpec::{
      , selector = schemas.LabelSelector::{
        , matchLabels = Some [ { mapKey = "name", mapValue = "nginx" } ]
        }
      , template = schemas.PodTemplateSpec::{
        , metadata = schemas.ObjectMeta::{ name = Some "nginx" }
        , spec = Some schemas.PodSpec::{
          , containers =
            [ schemas.Container::{
              , image = Some "nginx:1.15.3"
              , name = "nginx"
              , ports = Some [ schemas.ContainerPort::{ containerPort = 80 } ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

# Other supported file formats

You can convert between Dhall and the following file formats:

* JSON - `dhall-to-json` / `json-to-dhall`
* YAML - `dhall-to-yaml` / `yaml-to-dhall`
* XML - `dhall-to-xml` / `xml-to-dhall`
* Bash - `dhall-to-bash`
* Nix - `dhall-to-nix`

# Native language bindings

Dhall is not just a preprocessor for JSON/YAML

Some languages (like Haskell) can read Dhall files without going through JSON:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass    #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

module Example where

import Dhall (Generic, FromDhall, Text)

import qualified Dhall

data Configuration = Configuration
    { home       :: Text
    , privateKey :: Text
    , publicKey  :: Text
    } deriving (Generic, FromDhall, Show)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    config <- Dhall.input Dhall.auto "./config.dhall"

    print (config :: Configuration)
```

# Language bindings

The currently official language bindings are:

* Clojure
* Haskell
* Go
* Ruby
* Rust

… and there is one unofficial language binding that is worth mentioning:

* Java - Fairly comprehensive

The most wished-for language binding is Python

The latest list can be found at:

* [`docs.dhall-lang.org` - How to integrate Dhall](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/howtos/How-to-integrate-Dhall.html)

# Benefits of generating JSON/YAML

Many people generate JSON/YAML when they first start trying out Dhall, because:

* You can "try before you buy" (doesn't require immediate buy-in from your peers)

* Generating JSON/YAML is a more incremental migration path

* You can download prebuilt statically-linked executables for Windows/OS X/Linux

  * `dhall`
  * `dhall-to-{json,yaml}` / `{json,yaml}-to-dhall`
  * `dhall-lsp-server`

# Benefits of native language support

There are some benefits of reading a Dhall configuration file directly when
you commit more fully to the language:

* Simplicity

* Marshalling unions (a.k.a. sum types)

  JSON/YAML don't natively support sum types

* Marshalling functions

  For example, this works:

  ```haskell
  f :: (Natural -> [Natural]) <- Dhall.input Dhall.auto "λ(x : Natural) → [ x, x ]"

  print (f 2)  -- [ 2, 2 ]
  ```

  This is limited to monomorphic non-higher-order functions

# Questions?

# Dhall is a programming language

This means that you can factor out shared logic into (immutable) variables:

```haskell
let user = "bill"

in  { home       = "/home/${user}"
    , privateKey = "/home/${user}/.ssh/id_ed25519"
    , publicKey  = "/home/${user}/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
    }
```

… and use programming language features like string interpolation.

DEMO: [dhall-lang.org](https://dhall-lang.org/)

# Data model - simple types

Dhall supports the following simple ("scalar") types:

* `Bool`: `True`, `False`
* `Text`: `"Hello, world!"`
* `Natural`: `0`, `1`, `2`, …
* `Integer`: …, `-2`, `-1`, `+0`, `+1`, `+2`, …
* `Double`: `3.14159265`, `6.0221409e+23`

# Data model - complex types

Dhall also supports the following complex ("composite") types:

* `Optional`: `Some 1`, `None Natural`
* `List`: `[ 2, 3, 5 ]`, `[] : List Natural`
* Records: `{ x = 1.2, y = -2.5 }`
* Unions: `let Example = < Left : Natural | Right : Bool > in Example.Left 0`
    * Enums: `let DNA = < A | T | G | C > in [ DNA.A, DNA.T, DNA.C ]`

Complex types can be nested arbitrarily (like JSON/YAML, unlike INI/TOML)

# `Text`

Dhall's `Text` support is best-in-class among configuration languages

For example, Dhall supports string interpolation:

```haskell
λ(name : Text) → "Hello, ${name}!"
```

… and multi-line strings with automatic dedentation:

```haskell
let header = "Header"

let content = "Content"

in  ''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>${header}</h1>
    <p>${content}</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ''
```

# Records

Dhall supports Nix-style dotted-field syntax.  For example, this:

```haskell
{ a.b.c = 1, a.b.d = True }
```

… is the same thing as:

```haskell
{ a = { b = { c = 1, d = True } } }
```

This comes in handy when working with deeply-nested records.

Dhall is more flexible than Nix.  For example, this works in Dhall:

```haskell
{ a.b.c = 1, a = { b.d = 2 } }
```

… but does not work in Nix.

# Dhall has functions

You can avoid repeating yourself (DRY) using functions:

```haskell
let makeUser = \(user : Text) ->
      let home       = "/home/${user}"
      let privateKey = "${home}/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      let publicKey  = "${privateKey}.pub"
      in  { home, privateKey, publicKey }
in  [ makeUser "bill"
    , makeUser "jane"
    ]
```

… which is equivalent to this JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "home":       "/home/bill",
    "privateKey": "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519",
    "publicKey":  "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
  },
  {
    "home":       "/home/jane",
    "privateKey": "/home/jane/.ssh/id_ed25519",
    "publicKey":  "/home/jane/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
  }
]
```

# Dhall is typed

You can validate configuration files ahead of time using types:

```haskell
let Config : Type =
      { home       : Text
      , privateKey : Text
      , publicKey  : Text
      }

let makeUser : Text -> Config = \(user : Text) ->
      let home       : Text   = "/home/${user}"
      let privateKey : Text   = "${home}/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      let publicKey  : Text   = "${privateKey}.pub"
      let config     : Config = { home, privateKey, publicKey }
      in  config

let configs : List Config =
      [ makeUser "bill"
      , makeUser "jane"
      ]

in  configs
```

# Dhall has imports

You can embed other expressions by path:

```haskell
-- ./number.dhall

2
```

```haskell
-- This is valid Dhall code
./number.dhall + ./number.dhall
```

```haskell
-- More common idiom, equivalent to the previous code:
let number = ./number.dhall

in  number + number
```

… or by environment variable:

```haskell
"Hello, my name is ${env:USER as Text}"
```

# Dhall has imports

You can also embed other expressions by URL!

```haskell
let generate = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/List/generate.dhall

let makeUser = \(user : Text) ->
      let home       = "/home/${user}"
      let privateKey = "${home}/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      let publicKey  = "${privateKey}.pub"
      in  { home, privateKey, publicKey }

let buildUser = \(index : Natural) ->
      makeUser "build${Natural/show index}"

let Config =
      { home : Text
      , privateKey : Text
      , publicKey : Text
      }

in  generate 10 Config buildUser
```

The language design ensures that URL imports are secure

# Dhall has tests

Dhall provides language support for tests!

```haskell
--| `lessThanEqual` checks if one Natural is less than or equal to another.
let lessThanEqual
    : Natural → Natural → Bool
    = λ(x : Natural) → λ(y : Natural) → Natural/isZero (Natural/subtract y x)

let example0 = assert : lessThanEqual 5 6 ≡ True

let example1 = assert : lessThanEqual 5 5 ≡ True

let example2 = assert : lessThanEqual 5 4 ≡ False

…

in  lessThanEqual
```

# Emergent properties - package

You can implement derived features by mixing these simpler features

For example, a package is just a (potentially nested) record that you import:

```haskell
let Prelude = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/v20.0.0/package.dhall

in  Prelude.Bool.not True
```

# Emergent properties - template

In Dhall, a template is just a function that interpolates `Text`:

```haskell
\(args : { year : Natural, copyrightHolder : Text }) ->
  ''
  Copyright ${Natural/show args.year} ${args.copyrightHolder}

  ''
```

# Emergent properties - template

Here is an example of how you would apply a template using `dhall text`:

```bash
$ dhall text <<< './template.dhall { year = 2020, copyrightHolder = "Gabriella Gonzalez" }'

```

# Emergent properties - schema

A schema is just a type annotation that you import:

```haskell
-- ./schema.dhall
{ home : Text, privateKey : Text, publicKey : Text }
```

```haskell
-- ./config.dhall
{ home       = "/home/bill"
, privateKey = "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519"
, publicKey  = "/home/bill/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
} : ./schema.dhall
```

# Emergent properties - Property tests

A property test is just a unit test where both sides have the same normal form:

```haskell
--| `lessThanEqual` checks if one Natural is less than or equal to another.
let lessThanEqual
    : Natural → Natural → Bool
    = λ(x : Natural) → λ(y : Natural) → Natural/isZero (Natural/subtract y x)

…

let property0 = λ(n : Natural) → assert : lessThanEqual 0 n ≡ True

let property1 = λ(n : Natural) → assert : lessThanEqual n n ≡ True

in  lessThanEqual
```

This works because the interpreter can normalize abstract expressions

# Builtin functionality

Dhall has a very restricted set of primitive operations ("builtins")

* [`docs.dhall-lang.org` - Built-in types, functions, and operators](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/references/Built-in-types.html)

Main things that may surprise new users:

* No support for `Text` introspection
* No support for `Double` arithmetic
* `==`/`!=` only work on `Bool`s

The following page explains some of these design decisions:

* [`docs.dhall-lang.org` - Design choices](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/discussions/Design-choices.html)

**tl;dr**: The available built-ins discourage weakly-typed programming idioms

# Dhall is total

Dhall is a *total* functional programming language

This means Dhall configuration files never hang, crash, or throw exceptions

One benefit of being total is strong normalization:

```haskell
$ dhall repl
⊢ :let generate = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/List/generate.dhall

generate : ∀(n : Natural) → ∀(a : Type) → ∀(f : Natural → a) → List a

⊢ generate 10

λ(a : Type) →
λ(f : Natural → a) →
  [ f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5, f 6, f 7, f 8, f 9 ]
```

# Lack of recursion

Dhall does not provide language support for recursion

Recursion is not impossible; it's just not ergonomic.

For example, this is how Dhall models JSON:

```haskell
let JSON/Type
    : Type
    = ∀(JSON : Type) →
      ∀ ( json
        : { array : List JSON → JSON
          , bool : Bool → JSON
          , double : Double → JSON
          , integer : Integer → JSON
          , null : JSON
          , object : List { mapKey : Text, mapValue : JSON } → JSON
          , string : Text → JSON
          }
        ) →
        JSON

in  JSON/Type
```

See: [`docs.dhall-lang.org` - How to translate recursive code to Dhall](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/howtos/How-to-translate-recursive-code-to-Dhall.html)

# Dhall's type inference is limited

Dhall does not (yet) support bidirectional type inference

This means that the language requires types or type annotations in a few places,
like:

* An empty list:

  ```haskell
  [] : List Natural
  ```

* An empty `Optional` value:

  ```haskell
  None Natural
  ```

* A function's input type:

  ```haskell
  \(x : Natural) -> x + 1
  ```

* Specializing a polymorphic function:

  ```haskell
  Prelude.List.map Natural Natural (\(x : Natural) -> x + 1)
  ```

Prelude.Natural.listMax           Prelude.Natural.toInteger

⊢ Prelude.Natural.product [ 2, 3, 5 ]

30
```

# Rich diff - command line

The interpreter supports rich "diff"s of arbitrary expressions.  For example:

```haskell
$ dhall diff '{ x = [ 1, 2, 3 ], y = True }' '{ x = [ 2, 3, 4 ], z = "ABC" }'
{ - y = …
, + z = …
,   x = [ - 1
        , …
        , + 4
        ]

}
```

Only the difference is displayed.  Fields/elements/values in common are omitted

This feature is used in two places to improve the user experience

# Rich diff - type errors

The interpreter uses rich diffs to highlight what went wrong for type errors:

```haskell
⊢ :let Person = { name : Text, age : Natural }

Person : Type

⊢ { name = "John Doe", agee = 24 } : Person

Error: Expression doesn't match annotation

{ - age : …
, + agee : …
, …
}

1│ { name = "John Doe", agee = 24 } : Person

(input):1:1
```

This makes it easy to drill down to the offending typo, even for large records.

# Rich diff - tests

Also, test failures will display a rich diff:

```haskell
Error: Assertion failed

"[▮true, 1▮]"

1│ assert : JSON.renderCompact (JSON.array [ JSON.bool True, JSON.natural 1 ]) === "[true, 1]"

(input):1:1
```

# Hashing expressions - refactors

The language also supports hashing arbitrary expressions

Dhall hashes normal forms, so two αβ-equivalent expressions have the same hash:

```bash
$ dhall hash <<< '\(x : Bool) -> [ x && True, x || False ]'
sha256:486b561c6e38adf2c2853b6395358c16c3ed1befc35c33067996dcfb51a74e62

$ dhall hash <<< '\(y : Bool) -> [ y, y ]'
sha256:486b561c6e38adf2c2853b6395358c16c3ed1befc35c33067996dcfb51a74e62
```

You can verify that a refactor is behavior-preserving using these hashes

If the hash doesn't change, then it is a behavior-preserving refactor

These hashes are insensitive to:

* Comments / coding style
* Variable names
* Module organization

# Hashing expressions - integrity checks

You can protect a remote import with a hash of the import, like this:

```haskell

```

The hash serves two purposes here:

* The import is always verified against the hash to protect against tampering

* The import is cached locally in a content-addressable store

  … where the hash is the lookup key

# IDE support 

Dhall provides a language server (`dhall-lsp-server`):

![](https://dhall-lang.org/img/completion.gif)

This means that you can get IDE support for VSCode, Sublime, Emacs, and Vim

… and any other editor that supports the language server protocol

# Documentation generator

Dhall also includes a documentation generator (`dhall-docs`)

This plays a role analogous to Haskell's `haddock` tool

Examples:

* [Prelude documentation](https://hydra.dhall-lang.org/job/dhall-haskell/master/prelude-dhall-docs/latest/download/1/)
* [Kubernetes documentation](https://hydra.dhall-lang.org/job/dhall-haskell/master/kubernetes-dhall-docs/latest/download/1)

Note: there is not yet a repository for hosting packages and their documentation

# Package ecosystem

The most widely used Dhall package is the Prelude:

```haskell
let Prelude = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/v20.0.0/package.dhall
```

This package includes:

* Widely-used general-purpose utilities (analogous to Haskell's Prelude)
* Support for commonly used formats (e.g. JSON / XML)
* Types related to the core language (e.g. `Map` / `Location`)

Right now the main way to discover other Dhall packages is
[`awesome-dhall`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/awesome-dhall)

# Emergent properties - Validation

You can validation configuration values using the language support for tests:

```haskell
let Prelude = https://prelude.dhall-lang.org/v20.0.0/package.dhall

let Config = { opacity : Natural, minReplicas : Natural, maxReplicas : Natural }

let validateConfig =
      \(config : Config) ->
        let validOpacity = Prelude.Natural.lessThanEqual config.opacity 100

        let validReplicas = Prelude.Natural.lessThanEqual config.minReplicas config.maxReplicas

        in       { validOpacity = True, validReplicas = True }
            ===  { validOpacity, validReplicas }

let config
    : Config
    = { opacity = 101, minReplicas = 4, maxReplicas = 4 }

let validate = assert : validateConfig config

in  config
```

# Emergent properties - Test reports

Validation failures only highlight the tests that failed:

```haskell
Error: Assertion failed

{ validOpacity = - True
                 + False
, …
}

18│                assert : validateConfig config
19│
```

This makes use of the tooling support for rich diffs

# Questions?

# Language security

Dhall's is best-in-class when it comes to language security (LangSec)

This was the *raison d'être* for Dhall, to balance programming with safety

Most of what I'll cover can be found here:

* [`docs.dhall-lang.org` - Safety guarantees](https://docs.dhall-lang.org/discussions/Safety-guarantees.html)

[`dhall-lang.org`](https://dhall-lang.org/) explains our guiding principle:

> The language aims to support safely importing and evaluating untrusted Dhall
> code, even code authored by malicious users. We treat the inability to do so
> as a specification bug.

# Dhall is not Turing-complete

Pedantically, being Turing-complete or not does not mean much *per se*

However, preventing Turing-completeness means getting other things right, like:

* Having a type system (or some other form of static analysis)

* Eliminating escape hatches or back doors

* Forbidding general recursion

Note: There are benefits to avoiding Turing-completeness for theorem provers,
but Dhall is not a theorem prover

# What people actually care about

When people say they don't want Turing-complete config files, they really mean:

* They want to forbid arbitrary side effects

* They want configuration files to be easier to statically analyze

* They don't want configuration files to throw exceptions

Dhall gets these right, too, but there isn't a convenient short-hand for the
above features.

# Purity

The language's purity is the single greatest safeguard against malicious code

Specifically:

* The only permitted side-effect is importing Dhall code

  In other words, Dhall can not compromise the host machine in any way

* The import system protects against data exfiltration

  … so that Dhall configuration files cannot harvest/leak secrets/keys/passwords

* You can also completely disable all imports or just HTTP(S) imports

  … if you are extra paranoid and you don't need them

* Other than that, the language is completely pure

  The only other effect Dhall can have is via the program being configured

# Static analysis

The language's static analysis tools are the second most important safeguard

Specifically:

* The type system has no escape hatch

  This means that you can make very strong assertions about any expression that
  type-checks

* Integrity checks (hashes) provide even stronger guarantees about an expression

  I expand upon this in:

  [Semantic integrity checks are the next generation of semantic versioning](http://www.haskellforall.com/2017/11/semantic-integrity-checks-are-next.html)

* Strong normalization improves program comprehension

  You can reduce any Dhall config to an canonical normal form free of
  obfuscation

# URL import safety

Imports have additional safeguards:

* Integrity checks protect against man-in-the-middle attacks

* Caching protected imports mitigates usage tracking

* The [referential sanity check](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/standard/imports.md#referential-sanity-check) protects against the Dhall analog of cross-site scripting (XSS)

* The Dhall analog of the [same origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) protects against data exfiltration

* Dhall also uses [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to stop server-side request forging

# A secure web server
