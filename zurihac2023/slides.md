.reveal h1, .reveal h2, .reveal h3, .reveal h4, .reveal h5 {

The goals behind this talk are to:

- motivate monad transformers
- explain how to use them
- compare them to alternatives
- dispel some common myths

## Motivation

My audience will likely have two types of listeners:

- **<span style="color:#FFFFFF">those who have never heard of monad transformers</span>**

  Lots of professional haskellers in this category!

- **<span style="color:#FFFFFF">those who assume everyone's heard of them<span>**

  This was me for the longest time ðŸ˜…

Hopefully fewer people in both categories after today

## Prior knowledge

I'm assuming prior knowledge of Haskell basics

I'm **<span style="color:#F5A9B8">NOT</span>** assuming you know monad transformers

I'm going to teach monad transformers <span style="color:#5BCEFA">from scratch</span>

## Title

The title of this talk is tongue-in-cheek

It's pretty hip to dunk on monad transformers

â€¦ but monad transformers are good, actually!

# Outline

* **<span style="color:#FFFFFF">What are monad transformers for?</span>**
* Tutorial
* Comparison against algebraic effects
* Common misconceptions

## Monad transformers by example

```haskell
import Text.Read (readMaybe)

readInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
readInt = do
    string <- getLine
    return (readMaybe string)

readThreeInts :: IO (Maybe (Int, Int, Int))
readThreeInts = do
    maybeInt0 <- readInt
    case maybeInt0 of
        Nothing -> return Nothing
        Just int0 -> do
            maybeInt1 <- readInt
            case maybeInt1 of
                Nothing -> return Nothing
                Just int1 -> do
                    maybeInt2 <- readInt
                    case maybeInt2 of
                        Nothing -> return Nothing
                        Just int2 -> do
                            return (Just (int0, int1, int2))
main :: IO ()
main = do
    maybeThreeInts <- readThreeInts
    print maybeThreeInts
```

## Using MaybeT

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE BlockArguments #-}

import Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe (MaybeT(..), runMaybeT)
import Text.Read (readMaybe)

readInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
readInt = do
    string <- getLine
    return (readMaybe string)

readThreeInts :: IO (Maybe (Int, Int, Int))
readThreeInts = runMaybeT do
    int0 <- MaybeT readInt
    int1 <- MaybeT readInt
    int2 <- MaybeT readInt
    return (int0, int1, int2)
```

## Looping

```haskell
import Text.Read (readMaybe)

readInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
readInt = do
    string <- getLine
    return (readMaybe string)

ensureInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
ensureInt = do
    maybeInt <- ensureInt
    case maybeInt of
        Nothing -> ensureInt
        Just n  -> return (Just n)
```

## Without MaybeT

```haskell
import Control.Applicative ((<|>))
import Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe (MaybeT(..), runMaybeT)
import Text.Read (readMaybe) 

readInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
readInt = do
    string <- getLine
    return (readMaybe string)

ensureInt :: IO (Maybe Int)
ensureInt = runMaybeT loop
  where
    loop = MaybeT readInt <|> loop
```

Using `MaybeT` is **<span style="color:#F5A9B8">NOT</span>** shorter

â€¦ but in a sec I will argue it's <span style="color:#5BCEFA">still better</span>

# TODO

- Explain the difference between `transformers` and `mtl`
